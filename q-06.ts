//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and 
//end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
// Then print the name after striping the white spaces.


//const myname: string = "Ayesha";

//t is used for tab/space 
const myname: string = "\tAyesha"
console.log(myname);

//  \n is used for new line
const Myname: string = "\nAyesha"
console.log(Myname);

console.log(Myname.trim());
